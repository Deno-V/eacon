This is code implemented for Paper: EACon

1. `Mixtral` contains the code running with Mixtral 8x7B
2. `Vicuna` contains the code running with Vicuna 13B
3. `Mixtral` & `Vicuna`  contain nearly identical code, differing mainly in file and path names. We have separated them for convenience, as the organization of prompts (chat history, system prompt, ...) for input to the language models varies between the two models.

Follow detailed README.md in both two file folders.
